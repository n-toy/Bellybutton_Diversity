# Bellybutton_Diversity

## Resources
  Software: Javascript, HTML

## Project Overview
  Complete the Belly Button Dashboard. The goals are:
  * Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
  * Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
  * Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.
  
By setting up an HTML page using Bootstrap, we are able to add in elements onto the HTML webpage skeleton by using Javascript. With the dataset provided in a JSON format, a d3 listener is set up for user clicks on the webpage. The Plotly Javascript visuals update as a user interacts with the dashboard.
